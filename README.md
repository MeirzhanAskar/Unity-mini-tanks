# Unity-mini-tanks
A game for 2 players. First player plays as a red tank, second plays as a green one. Red tank movement: WASD, Firing: Space. Green tank movement : ArrowKeys, Firing: KeyPadSpace. 2 PowerUps (health and shield).
My first project game in unity. You have two tanks. One of them is red and the other one is green. Every player has 3 health.
When you shoot a bullet, you have 2 second cooldown(preventing you from spamming the fire button). 
There are also boxes on the map that can be moved and broken by shooting at it. 
When the game starts, every 20 seconds one of two power ups randomly appear. 
The first powerup is health. When you collect it, your health will increase +1. Otherwise if you have full health then it will just be collected and won't do anything
Second powerup is the shield. When collected, it gives you 8 seconds immune to any damage. When it's being used, the shield status appears on the player.
Each power up has 10 second time before disapearing.
When one of the players dies, the game will be over and it will announce the winner.
To restart the game press R.
To toggle on or off the power up press M. (It's set on by the default)
